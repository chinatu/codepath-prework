## Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

##An app idea I would like to build
I would like to build an app that allows users to learn the Igbo language, the app would use AI to make learning very intuitive
assessing what users are good at and strengthening weak zone. Both Audio and texts would be inputs.
The app would have very interactive cards and in some cases flash cards for users to go through
The app would also implement leaderboards by proximity. i.e you get to compete against people in your location. PS: this option can be 
editable to allow users to broaden their location axis
